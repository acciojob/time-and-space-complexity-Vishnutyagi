	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>The time complexity of an algorithm quantifies the amount 
		of time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of
		the length of the input in an efficient way. Note that the time to run is a 
		function of the length of the input and not the actu
		al execution time of the machine on which the
		algorithm is running on. </p>
	<p>The term <b>Space Complexity</b> is misused for Auxiliary Space at many places. 
		Following are the correct definitions of Auxiliary Space an
		d <b>Space Complexity</b>. liners space have <b>Space Complexity</b> O(n)</p>
